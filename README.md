## Abstract


## üöÄ Features

- üîç **Deep Learning Architecture for Fraud Detection:**  
  A unique deep learning model specifically designed to detect fraudulent activities within supply chain analytics.

- üéØ **Dimensionality Reduction with PCA:**  
  Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is utilized to streamline high-dimensional data, ensuring optimal performance while avoiding the curse of dimensionality.

- ‚öôÔ∏è **Bayesian Optimization for Hyperparameter Tuning:**  
  Hyperparameters are fine-tuned using advanced Bayesian optimization techniques to maximize the model's accuracy.

- ‚öñÔ∏è **Class Imbalance Handling with SMOTE:**  
  Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) effectively balances the dataset by oversampling the minority class, enhancing fraud detection.

- üìä **Benchmark Evaluation on Real-World Data:**  
  Evaluated on the 'DataCo smart supply chain for big data analysis' dataset, the model delivers a 94.71% fraud detection rate and an overall accuracy of 99.42%.

- üõ†Ô∏è **Comparative Analysis with Other Models:**  
  The model is benchmarked against individual machine learning and deep learning classifiers, as well as state-of-the-art models in supply chain analytics, demonstrating superior performance.
